Datascapes is a 3-channel projection installation which takes viewers on a virtual journey through a series of surreal formations of landscapes. Viewers float through and around the starry “particle” landscapes that slowly begin to encroach into the gallery space. The installation, inspired by experiences with nature, encourages viewers to immerse themselves through the projected virtual environment with the goal to reignite our connection with nature beyond our corporeal limits. </p>

<p>Virtual reality, which is the basis of Datascapes, has the ability to teleport our consciousness, our essence, and our agency to other worlds. I find it interesting to intersect this experience by depicting our natural world through the process of Photogrammetry. For 2 years I’ve been exploring this digital process which has broken my previous monotony of working behind the screen, bent over at my desk working on digital content. Instead, photogrammetry has taken me outside the studio, beyond the screen to explore the world around me in a time of reemergence post-pandemic.  This digital process now allows me, as an artist, to create virtual assets for my art from the natural world without disruption and bring these forms of nature back to the studio to then be digitally reconstructed.</p>
<p>Datascapes' presentation as projection installation lessens the requirement of user-interface through interaction and instead allows the viewers to accompany the space with their bodies to engage and immerse themselves within the visuals and sound components of the work. In doing so, viewers are able to focus on the importance of the natural ambience of the installation while also getting lost in time.  Datascapes is the accumulation of my personal journey of reemergence back into the real world as a person and artist. Datascapes create a bridge, a virtual portal, between nature and the gallery space, and through technology we can create new ways of experience and connection with our world.</p>

Special thanks to my family, Thesis Committee, and Department for the amazing support and effort to get me where I’m at today. Also, all of the audio elements of the installed work is produced through direct collaboration with Akemi Sato, a previous DMA graduate from SJSU. The final visuals were produced by me utilizing RealityCapture software and Blender3D.

<p>The day I first picked up a game controller and witnessed the glimmer of pixels dancing on the T.V. screen, I knew video games were my destiny. Not only were they entertainment for me at an early age, but they did something that other forms of media couldn’t capture, immersion. Video games were like portals to other worlds; unlike books, movies, and other forms of entertainment, theses video games were completely interactive, could feature amazing story telling, and impactful narratives that the player guided. Growing up after the rebirth and rise of a new video game era, I was implanted with the seeds of inspiration, urging me to pursue a career in the video game industry.</p>
           
<p>To do that I had to focus and figure out what talents I possessed that would help me achieve the skills to become a master. My skills in illustration were apparent, but my creative ideas helped me push and succeed in becoming an artist. My current skills and studies are more oriented towards digital media, spanning past video game design into the realms of 2D visuals, 3D modeling, web design, coding, programming, installations and other tech based mediums. Along with these experiences I have also achieved a rich background in pictorial arts that reaches throughout the world and its history. Using the knowledge, skill, and practice that comes from studying and self-practice has put me in a balanced position where I can only go forward with advancing my artistic skill and keeping that creative innovation.</p>

<p>In my art, I too quest towards the same goals that the video games of my past managed to reach. The magic of an immersive and interactive experience that doesn’t tie down the player to the bounds of reality. To recreate the beauties of life digitally and be able to break downs walls and show the true realties of the world. My art, along with my scope is compared to that of a character leveling up, it and I have no max level and from our progression I feel I’ve come closer to achieving, and surpassing my goals. I have created games both digital and physical, that span over different genres and partake in an engaging setting that puts you in the front seat, driving the story. </p>
